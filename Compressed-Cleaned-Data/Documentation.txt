--Cleaned--

Removed only redundant attributes + characteristics, so here no information is lost.

--Compressed--

Removed also attributes which have over 95% of the samples in one characterisation. 
This should be usefull for frequent item set method and maybe some other statistics which had issues with those attributes.

The .arff files (Weka) are ready to go, as labels + data is in one file.
The .txt files (Matlab) have removed attributes, but not removed characteristics. 
Those are stored in attribute_headers_compressed.
Also if you need .data files, just copy paste out of the .txt files, as im having a hard time to work on .data files
and i dont need it for my algorithms.
